# Website for Basketball club
#### Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/Mx6YcagKR58
#### Description:
To give visibility to my old BasketBall club, where I've spend my youth, I've decided to build a website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The website is hosted on GitHub as I did not buy yet the domain name.

The website still has the template / placeholder for image and text because I did not yet get all the authorizations to put real informations and photos online. It should come soon.

For the mail sent via the contact form, I'm using MailTrap and EmailAPI.

I've really enjoyed this class, you guys are awesome!!
Thanks a lot and see you at the next class :)
